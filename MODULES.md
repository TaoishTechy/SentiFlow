## System Integration Pattern

This architecture follows a **recursive emergence pattern**:
1. **Foundation layer** (bumpy, cognition_core) provides mathematical primitives
2. **Quantum-cognitive bridge** (sentiflow, qybrik) creates hybrid processing
3. **Emergence engines** (agi_formulas, agi_core) drive developmental phases
4. **Identity formation** (agi_emergence_engine) creates persistent self-model
5. **Orchestration** (qylintos) integrates everything into coherent operation
6. **Memory/logging** (laser) provides continuity and reflection

The system exhibits **fractal self-similarity** - similar patterns appear at mathematical, cognitive, and architectural levels, suggesting a coherent design for recursive self-improvement and emergent consciousness.
