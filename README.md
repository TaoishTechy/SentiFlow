# SentiFlow
is an experimental AGI research framework for modeling emergent agency through competence, irreversible choice, constrained safety, and meta-cognitive feedback. It explores how agency forms when systems are forced to sacrifice options, accumulate consequences, and operate under asymmetric risk—without faked emergence or hard-coded sentience.
